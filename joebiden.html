<h1> What caused the Bear Flag Revolt?</h1>

    <p> <font size="+2"> During the mid-19th century settlers from America began to settle land in the Mexican-controlled territory of California. Since 1821 Mexico had been independent of Spain and the Department of Alta California had become a part of Mexico. As more Americans settled in California, Mexican governance grew less and less and as such Mexico made a plan to reinstate order in the region. In early 1846 an edict made by Mexican Governor Jose Casto stated that only naturalized Mexican citizens were authorized to purchase land, therefore negating the settlers claims to their land. </p> 
        
    <p> Rumours spread amongst the settlers that this law would soon be enforced and any and all American settlers in California would be forced to leave. Settlers held talks with the US Army (specifically Captain John Fremont) in which the army encouraged settlers to resist Mexican opposition. On June 9th, it had been discovered that Mexican General Mariano Vallejo had sent many horses to Castro to help enforce Mexican rule over California. The settlers knew that this would be the beginning of the end if they didn't fight back and as such the Bear Flag Revolt began. </font></p>
